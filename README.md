Antler blastema progenitor cell (ABPC) is a novel type of skeletal mesenchymal stem cell with strong stemness and renewal ability. Here, we discovered that ABPC-derived extracellular vesicles (EVsABPCs) exerted strong geroprotective effect on aging tissues in aged mice and rhesus macaques (*Macaca mulattas*). We identified a variety of rejuvenating molecules in EVsABPCs that differed from those in EVs derived from rat bone marrow stromal stem cells (EVsBMSCs). *In vitro*, EVsABPCs rejuvenated senescent BMSCs and shifted their molecular signature towards a youthful state. *In vivo*, EVsABPCs increased femoral bone mineral density in mice and rhesus macaques by 2.5-fold and 1.5-fold, respectively. Besides, intravenous EVsABPCs significantly outperformed fetal-EVsBMSCs in improving physical performance, enhancing cognitive function, reducing systemic inflammation, and preserving major tissues in elderly mice. Notably, the aging clock highlights a roughly 3.54-months regression in overall aging in mice. Additionally, EVsABPCs showed similar geroprotective effects in elderly rhesus macaques, markedly improving locomotor performance and mitigating cortical volume atrophy. Conclusively, these findings suggest that the ABPC is a novel and practical source of EVs containing systemic rejuvenating factors and has considerable translational value for anti-aging interventions, particularly the rescue of aging bone.
